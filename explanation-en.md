# Washington State (WA) Driving Test Score Sheet Explained & Preparation Guide

## I. Score Sheet Basics

This score sheet is the standard form used by examiners during the WA driving skills test to evaluate your performance. It covers various driving maneuvers and general driving behaviors. The examiner marks errors according to specific criteria, leading to point deductions.

## II. Deduction Code Explanations

| Code | Full Name            | Meaning                                                      | Description                                                  |
| :--- | :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DP` | Danger Potential     | Errors that could potentially lead to a dangerous situation. | Usually results in higher point deductions.                  |
| `LS` | Lack of Skill        | Errors demonstrating insufficient skill but not immediate danger. | Results in lower point deductions.                         |
| `CP` | Congestion Potential | Errors that could unnecessarily impede traffic flow.         | Also results in lower point deductions.                      |

## IV. WA Road Skill Test Preparation Plan (Based on Score Sheet)

Use this plan, focusing on the areas evaluated by the score sheet, to prepare for your test:

1.  **Know Your Vehicle (`Mechanical Operation`)**:
    * Practice smooth starts, stops, acceleration, and braking.
    * Master clutch control (if applicable).
    * Maintain proper hand positioning (e.g., 9 & 3 or 8 & 4). Avoid excessive one-handed steering.
    * Know how to use signals, lights, wipers, defroster, and parking brake instinctively.

2.  **Master Maneuvers (`Backing`, `Parallel Parking`, `Hill Park`)**:
    * **Backing:** Practice looking back primarily over your right shoulder, using mirrors minimally. Aim for a straight path, controlled speed, and smooth stops. Practice backing around a corner if possible.
    * **Parallel Parking:** Find a reliable method. Practice frequently until smooth, centered, reasonably close to the curb without hitting it, and within limited adjustments. Remember signals and observation.
    * **Hill Parking:** Know the rules: Uphill w/ curb (wheels away), Downhill w/ curb (wheels toward), No curb (wheels toward road edge). Practice setting the parking brake *before* shifting to Park, and reversing the process on start. Ensure no rolling.

3.  **Perfect Traffic Interaction (`Turns`, `Lanes`, `Intersections`, `Following`, `Passing`, `ROW`)**:
    * **Turns (Left/Right):** Signal 100ft in advance. Observe traffic/pedestrians thoroughly. Enter/exit in the *nearest correct* lane. Maintain proper speed. Avoid cutting corners or swinging wide.
    * **Lane Changes:** SMOG: Signal, Mirrors, Over-the-shoulder (blind spot), Go (if clear). Maintain speed. Do not change lanes within intersections.
    * **Lane Travel:** Stay centered. Avoid weaving.
    * **Intersections (Controlled/Uncontrolled):** Scan thoroughly (left-center-right-left). Obey signs/signals. Be prepared to yield at uncontrolled intersections per rules. Make complete stops behind lines/crosswalks.
    * **Following Distance:** Maintain a 3-4 second distance in good conditions.
    * **Passing:** Only if necessary and safe. Follow SMOG.
    * **Right-of-Way (ROW):** Know the rules explicitly. Be decisive but safe – don't force others to react, but don't hesitate excessively when you have the ROW.

4.  **Develop Excellent Observation Habits (`Vis`)**:
    * Constantly scan: ahead, behind (mirrors every 5-8 secs), sides.
    * Check blind spots *before* lane changes or pulling from the curb.
    * Look carefully for pedestrians and cyclists.

5.  **Refine Speed and Control (`Spd`, `Ctl`, `Stp`)**:
    * Drive at the speed limit unless conditions warrant lower speeds. Don't drive excessively slow.
    * Maintain smooth acceleration and braking.
    * Make complete, smooth stops where required.

6.  **Cultivate General Awareness & Attitude (`Attn`, `Hes`)**:
    * Stay focused on driving. Anticipate potential hazards.
    * Be confident but not aggressive. Avoid unnecessary hesitation, prioritize safety.

7.  **Study the WA Driver Guide**:
    * Ensure you know all Washington State traffic laws, sign meanings, and right-of-way rules.

8.  **Practice in Various Conditions**:
    * Drive in different traffic levels, times of day, and weather (if safe).

9.  **Mock Test**:
    * Practice on likely test routes near the testing center, if possible.
    * Have an experienced driver or instructor simulate the test using this score sheet, providing critical feedback.
